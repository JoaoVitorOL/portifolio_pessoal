  "habilidades.repositorio.descricao2": "Endless Topdown game developed on Construct 2 engine for my university Games subject. The game consists of a character who has to survive as much time as possible in a scenary with obstacles and enemies that spawns periodically. Get as many points as possible before being defeated. In each new wave, creatures get faster and become more frequent. Moreover, new monster types will emerge. The game is over only when you die, with no progress saving possibility. Player can collect coins and activate power-ups to updgrade abilities. ",
